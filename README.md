# GetPet

GetPet is a mobile application that creates long-lasting friendships by helping homeless animals find their home.

GetPet was born as a social initiative, which brought together a team of talented volunteers.

GetPet promotes social responsibility, seeks to create an emotionally healthier society and is acting for the animalsâ€™ good.
